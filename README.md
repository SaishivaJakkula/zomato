⭐ Zomato EDA Project (Short & Sweet Theory Version)

I performed an Exploratory Data Analysis on Zomato restaurant data to understand restaurant performance, customer preferences, and pricing patterns.

1. Data Understanding
Explored dataset structure, identified key columns like ratings, cost, cuisine type, service features, and location.

2. Data Cleaning
Handled missing values, removed unnecessary columns, standardized column names, and ensured consistent data formats.

3. Data Preparation
Organized the dataset, grouped restaurants by type, area, service features, and cuisine categories to identify patterns.

4. Exploratory Data Analysis
Analyzed rating distribution, cost patterns, cuisine popularity, and area-wise restaurant density.
Studied the impact of online ordering and table booking on customer ratings and popularity.
Compared rating trends across different restaurant types and cuisines.

5. Insights Generation
Identified most popular cuisines, top restaurant areas, key pricing trends, and service features affecting customer satisfaction.
Learned that cost doesn’t directly determine ratings—service quality and convenience matter more.

6. Conclusion
The EDA helped uncover customer behavior trends, service-related impacts, and restaurant performance insights that can support better decision-making for restaurants and food platforms.
