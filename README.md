# 🍽️ Zomato EDA — A Dark & Meaningful Exploration

I explored the Zomato restaurant dataset not just to analyze numbers,  
but to uncover the hidden patterns behind human choices —  
the taste of a city, the comfort we seek, and the story each restaurant quietly carries.

## 1.  Data Understanding  
Unveiled the raw structure of the data — ratings, costs, cuisines, areas —  
each column holding a fragment of truth about customer behavior and food culture.

## 2. 🧹 Data Cleaning  
Removed noise, handled missing pieces, and brought clarity to messy values.  
The dataset became sharper, calmer, and ready to reveal its secrets.

## 3. 🗂️ Data Preparation  
Grouped restaurants by type, cuisine, service features, and location.  
Turned scattered information into a meaningful, structured landscape.

## 4. 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis  
Visualized rating patterns, cost distributions, cuisine popularity,  
and area-wise restaurant density.  
Measured the impact of online ordering and table booking  
on customer satisfaction and restaurant popularity.

## 5. 🔍 Key Insights  
- Price alone doesn't define success — service quality does.  
- Online-order and table-booking options improve customer engagement.  
- Certain cuisines dominate demand and ratings.  
- A few areas act as the true heartbeat of the city's food culture.

## 6. 🏁 Conclusion  
This EDA wasn’t just about restaurants.  
It was about people — their habits, their cravings,  
and the choices they make when they seek comfort in food.
